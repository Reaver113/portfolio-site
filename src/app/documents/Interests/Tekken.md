##### TEKKEN

<div clasName='paragraphWrapper'>
When I first started playing <b>TEKKEN</b> seriously, I quickly realized it wasn’t just about pressing buttons, it was about understanding the <b>mechanics</b> behind every move. <b>Frame data</b> was one of the first things I had to wrap my head around. I learned that every attack has <b>startup frames</b> (how fast it comes out), <b>active frames</b> (when it can hit), and <b>recovery frames</b> (how long I’m stuck afterward). The most important part was figuring out <b>frame advantage</b>, if my move left me at negative frames, my opponent could act first, but if I had plus frames, I could keep the pressure going. I also had to start recognizing which moves were unsafe so I could punish properly instead of letting my opponent get away with mistakes. At first, it was overwhelming, especially since every character has so many moves, but the more I played, the more these things started clicking.

What really stood out to me was how much <b>TEKKEN</b> forces you to <b>learn and adapt constantly</b>. I couldn’t just memorize frame data and expect to win, I had to watch my opponent and <b>adjust my playstyle on the fly</b>. At first, I got frustrated when I kept getting hit by certain strings or mixups, but I started paying <b>attention to patterns</b>. If someone kept using the same approach, I learned how to sidestep or interrupt them at the right moment. Wall pressure was another thing I had to get used to; I learned the hard way that being stuck against a wall means I can’t backdash out of danger. Every match felt like a <b>puzzle</b>, and while my execution was important, <b>reading my opponent</b> and making <b>quick decisions</b> mattered just as much. The more I played, the more I realized that TEKKEN isn’t just about reaction speed—it’s about constantly adapting and outthinking whoever’s in front of me.
