##### Building and Flying FPV Drones

  When I first started <b>building my own FPV drone</b>, I quickly realized it was more than just putting parts together, it was a mix of <b>electronics, mechanics, and software tuning</b>. I had to choose the right components: a sturdy frame, a <b>flight controller</b> with the right <b>firmware</b> (I went with Betaflight), <b>ESCs</b> that could handle my motor’s power, and a video system that wouldn’t introduce too much latency. <b>Soldering</b> was a skill I had to pick up fast since proper wiring is crucial for a stable build. Once everything was assembled, I spent hours in <b>Betaflight</b> configuring my flight controller, calibrating the sensors, and tweaking <b>PID</b> settings to make sure my drone wouldn’t just flip over the moment I tried to take off.

  Flying an FPV drone was a completely different challenge. Unlike regular drones with <b>GPS stabilization</b>, my quad relied <b>entirely on my inputs</b>, and every mistake meant a crash. Before taking it outside, I spent a lot of time in a <b>simulator</b> to build <b>muscle memory</b>, getting used to controlling <b>throttle, yaw, pitch, and roll</b> simultaneously. The first real flights were nerve-wracking, but also a lot of fun. I had to learn about <b>video transmission</b>, ensuring my <b>antennas</b> were positioned correctly, and staying within legal <b>frequency and power limits</b>. I also had to be mindful of weather conditions and make sure my <b>fail-safes</b> were set up properly in case of signal loss. Every flight <b>taught me something new</b>, and while the crashes were frustrating, the thrill of flying through my goggles made all the effort <b>worth it</b>.
