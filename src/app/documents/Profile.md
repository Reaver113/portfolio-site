A **Full Stack Web Developer** from the Gold Coast with a **passion for learning and understanding new things**. I enjoy **Front End development** because it allows me to work on visually appealing designs and has a clear visual reward when the work is complete, while **Back End development** allows me to work on my fundamental programming knowledge and problem solving skills. Working in development has been been an amazing experience because it has allowed me to **apply my learned skills from my hobbies to work** and visa versa. In my free time I enjoy building and working on my **home server(s)**, flying and building **FPV drones**, and playing **TEKKEN**.
